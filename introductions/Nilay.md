## Introduction
Hey! I am Nilay, a Pre-Grad CSE student from Nagpur. I am descent at web development, usually work with NextJs, Flask and Django for building applications. All of which I learnt about NextJs while participating in Hackathons. I also found myself play around different techs so I am just moving myself into Rust and Blockchain. I am good at building Restful APIs using DRF and simple flask apps just to deploy and creating gateways for my ML models. I am currently a GDSC Lead at my Campus.
Also I am community freak, meaning I am active into most of Nagpur's communities that are GDG Nagpur, WTM Nagpur, CNCF Nagpur as a UI/UX team Lead, back then at ScribbleDAO as creating content for startups.

Looking ahead to learn alot from these programs and collaborate with folks.
