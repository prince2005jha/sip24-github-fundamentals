## Introduction
Hello ! My name is Tilak and I am 21 yrs old. I was born and brought up in city Mumbai, India. Talking about my educational background, I have done my schooling from Thakur Vidya Mandir High School (2018), Kandivali, Mumbai. I have completed Diploma in Digital Electronics from Shri Bhagubhai Mafatlal Polytechnic (2018-21), Ville Parle, Mumbai. And currently persuing undergraduate course in Electronics and Telecommunication from St. Francis Institute Of Technology (2021-24), Borivali, Mumbai. My crave for listening to songs is always at its peak tbh. Apart from listening songs my some part of life also falls into the Musical Era. Being a musician I am a Guitarist and I have also recomposed about 15 songs. Reality by Lost Frequencies is one of my most loved composition. I am also a poet (sometimes), being an author for about 10 poems. Since childhood my most of the hobbies mainly lie into the Technical field and one of them is Web developement. Living in an superstitious society I am kindoff religious person who loves visiting temple every weekend and participating in the religious practices which works for the welfare of the society. So thats all from my side. Thank You : )
