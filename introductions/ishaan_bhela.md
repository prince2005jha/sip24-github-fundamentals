## Introduction
Hello, My name is Ishaan Bhela. I attend the Symbiosis Institute of Technology in Pune, India, as a student. I've finished beginner-level learning from many online resources like udemy, edx etc. I know a fair bit of Java and C++. In addition, I've created several projects including Flappy Bird and Tic-tac-toe.
I am now eager to study more in-depth information about software development, data structures, algorithms, and computer science principles to enhance my skills and knowledge in the field, focusing on real-world applications and professional practices.
