## Introduction
Hi everyone,
I’m Kiran, and I recently completed my BCA. I’m thrilled to be a part of this team and eager to embark on this journey of growth and learning.

A little about me:
- **Background:** I recently completed an internship in data analytics and am currently enrolled in a certification course on data analytics. This course covers SQL, advanced Excel, Python, Power BI, and Tableau. My main goal for this internship is to develop my soft skills and confidence, as well as enhance my technical skills.
- **Interests:** I’m particularly passionate about data science and analytics. While I'm already proficient in Python, SQL, Excel, and Git, I’m continuously striving to improve and expand my technical knowledge.
- **Certifications:** You can find all my certifications related to data analytics on my LinkedIn profile. 

**Fun Fact:** In my free time, I enjoy watching anime. I’m excited about the opportunity to learn from each of you, gain valuable soft skills and confidence, and further develop my technical skills to contribute to the team’s success.

Best,
Kiran
