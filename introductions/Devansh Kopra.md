## Introduction
Hi everyone! I'm Devansh Kopra, an aspiring Data Science Student.
Currently I'm just done with my Third Year of BE in CSE and Data Science from Mumbai University.
My primary focus lies on Front-end Development because of my Creative and visual thinking. I enjoy working on group projects as well as solo projects to keep up with the current technological advancements of the software world.
I come across as an ideal leader because I tend to perform brilliantly under pressure too!
Looking forward to put my knowledge to use here in this internship and boost my career upwards!
