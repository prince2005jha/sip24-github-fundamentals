## Introduction
Hello, I'm Dheeren Gaud, a third-year student at the FCIT (Faculty of Computer and Information Technology) pursuing a degree in Information Technology. I reside in the bustling city of Mumbai, India.

I have a keen interest in backend coding and enjoy exploring new technologies and frameworks to improve my skills. I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to apply my knowledge to real-world projects and gain practical experience.

Apart from coding, I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends, watching movies, and listening to music.
