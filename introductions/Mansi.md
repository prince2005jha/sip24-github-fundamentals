As a highly motivated and technically proficient student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering. My technical journey includes internships at Alhansat Solutions and HEXBit.io, where I honed my Full Stack Developer skills, developing web applications with JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. With a solid foundation in Java, Python, SQL, and tools like Git, Postman, and Figma, I excel in dynamic environments. My projects, including a Google authentication web application, showcase my ability to create user-centric solutions. I am eager to leverage my skills and passion for innovation in software engineering.
