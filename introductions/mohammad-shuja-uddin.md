## Introduction
I'm Mohammad Shuja Uddin, a passionate software engineering student
currently studying at Fast National University of Science and Technology in Islamabad, Pakistan. My journey started at Cadet College Swat, where I completed my Matriculation and Intermediate studies from 2016 to 2021. Since 2022, I've been immersed in my software engineering degree, focusing on honing my skills in advanced C++, Figma, and logical development.

I've developed proficiency in several programming languages including C++, Python, Java, C#, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm also familiar with frameworks like Spring and Spring Boot, and tools such as JavaFX and Git/GitHub.

To complement my studies, I've pursued courses that keep me updated with industry trends, including Introduction to Cloud Computing (IBM, 2024), Responsive Web Design (FreeCodeCamp, 2024), and Data Structures & Algorithms Using C++ (IBM, 2023). These courses have expanded my technical knowledge and equipped me with practical skills.

I'm actively engaged in the tech community online, sharing my projects and connecting with like-minded individuals. My communication skills are enhanced by fluency in English, native proficiency in Urdu, and basic knowledge of Pashto.
