Computer Science at Government College Quepem. My educational journey is part of the New Education Policy (NEP) initiative, offering a

Experience:
 During my internship with the IEEE Bombay Section, I worked as a Full Stack Developer on the Devstar project. My role involved
developing code beautification tools using Svelte and SvelteKit, co-leading a team, managing workflows, and integrating various project
components. This experience not only enhanced my technical capabilities but also honed my leadership and team management skills.

Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy cycling, jogging, and playing the guitar. These activities keep me balanced,energized, and creative.
