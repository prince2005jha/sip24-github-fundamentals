## Introduction
Hey, I'm Purvi Passi. Currently a Computer Engineering student at FCRIT, Vashi. I'm creative, ambitious and a fast learner, who loves to explore and volunteer for new opportunities with knowledge in managing projects, events, and resources with a background in creative thinking and implementation. I'm learning more about data science trends and machine learning technologies to be able to provide better to the industry. I've honed my skills in Python, SQL, Flutter, Java, Power BI, UI/ UX and ML tech like Image processing, NLP, K-Means, Random Forest etc. I am eager to learn more about web dev and hence am delighted to be a part of Meta Craftlab as an Intern. Happy learning!
